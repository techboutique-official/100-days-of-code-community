# 100-days-of-code-community 

Welcome to 100-days-of-code! We are glad that you registered for it! This is not only for us to learn code , but also to create a community of devs who are starting from zero to hero. If you are in this page you should have recieved the mail from us. In order to be a participant, you need to be registered with us. If you are not, you can mail us to techboutique.official@gmail.com. You can ping us for any more queries as needed. You can also register as a community manager or help us in task list design as well.  

### Why 100-days-of-code? 

This challenge will help you inculcate the habit of coding everyday apart from coding you do academically or professionally. If you perform well in the 100-days we will send you Dev-stickers to your place (if within India). We would be happy if any generous people come along to sponsor Dev-goodies for better incentives for people to join. All sponsors will be publicised on our social media platforms

### What is the cost? 

We are taking no cost for you to enroll. We expect you to spread the word and give credit for the tasks we are designing.

### What we expect 

We expect you to complete this journey on a day to day basis but we provide you a day of buffer of Saturday and you will be given tasks from Monday to Friday. We will try our best to provide you with tasks that can be completed within 90 minutes or so. We expect you to post your task progress everyday using #100daysofcode on either linkedin or twitter tagging us. 

### What are we learning? 

We are learning from scratch HTML/CSS and we will be focussing lot on Javascript which we will be doing from basics to advanced. As React uses JS we don't want no loopholes in javascript basics. We will then be moving to creating basic animations in javascript which are commonly used in Webpages. We want you to learn how to create these from scratch and not use any templates or a existing library. After that we will be moving forward to MERN stack.
